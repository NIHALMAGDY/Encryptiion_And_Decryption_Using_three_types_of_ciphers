# Encryptiion and decryption using three types of ciphers
This file contains encryptiion and decryption methods like  shift, affine, and vigenere ciphers.

The should be callable from command line as follows:

◦ First argument is the cipher type [“shift”,”affine”,”vigenere”].

◦ Second argument is the operation type [“enc”, “dec”].

◦ The Third argument is the input file.

◦ The fourth argument is the output file.

◦ The last argument is the the list of encryption keys required for the cipher.

I hope this code will be helpful to you
