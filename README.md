# Encryptiion_And_Decryption_Using_three_types_of_ciphers
This file contains encryptiion and decryption methods like  shift, affine, and vigenere ciphers.
The should be callable from command line as follows:
◦ First argument is the cipher type [“shift”,”affine”,”vigenere”].
◦ Second argument is the operation type [“enc”, “dec”].
◦ The Third argument is the input file.
◦ The fourth argument is the output file.
◦ The last argument is the the list of encryption keys required for the cipher.
I hope this code will be helpful to you
